# Programming Your GPU with OpenMP

This is a hands-on tutorial that introduces the basics of targetting GPUs with OpenMP 4.5 through a series of worked examples.

Starting with serial code, the tutorial takes you thorugh parallellising, exploring the performance characteristics, and optimising the following small programs:

* `vadd` – A simple vector addition program, often considered the "hello world" of GPU programming.
* `pi` – A numerical integration program that calculates and approximate value of π.
* `jac_solv` – A Jacobi solver.
* `heat` - An explicit finite difference 5-point stencil code.
