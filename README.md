# Bonn2025

This repository holds materials for my lectures and workshops presented at 
the University of Bonn during the weeks of March 24 to 28.  This is a temporary 
repository by which I mean it will be removed from my github account a few months 
after my visit to Bonn.  

For permanent archival access of workshop materials, use the repository:

https://github.com/tgmattso/ParProgForPhys.git

For the lectures, archival storage will be in the repositories:

https://github.com/tgmattso/CompSciForPhys.git
